# how_to_regression_problem
This is an example of how to use Python libraries for regression problems. Ideal for all those who want to learn simple ML techniques.

The aim of this notebook is to introduce you to the core concepts in developing and building a machine learning model, including:

1. An overview of Machine Learning; 
2. An overview of the the Machine Learning workflow; 
3. An introduction, through explanations and code, of the key machine learning libraries in `python`; and
4. Familiariry with the `collaboratory` environment 

In each of the Machine Learning projects it is important to understand the workflow. This diagram summarizes the steps within these projects.
